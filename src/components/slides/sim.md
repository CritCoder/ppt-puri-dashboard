add a new slide16 in the end @components 

@Slide2.js 

@slide11 

and build a UI for a fancy crowd Planning simulation and monitoring platform. 

in left it will have a sidebar with 3 menu items 

start with plan and sim and then monitroing. 


for planning i will put in the area and objective where i will have a map. hardcode api key and a input box which will ask me for objective. 

it will have sliders for safety and personlle. 

and once i give the input and event objective it will give out a planned routes, personel positions, choke points, Vulnerabile point etc. 

and allow me to adjust the slider of personnel 

it will also have input on the crowd estimate like how many people coming and how, for example 10K people, 8 from bus, 1 from car 1 from plane etc and the impact of this crowd in the traffic . 

i shold be able to modify the numbers and see visulization change
