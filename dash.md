I'll reorganize the widgets into these 3 core categories for better focus and clarity:

1. Live Dashboard (Real-time Situation Awareness)
- Critical Incidents Map
  - Live incident plotting with severity indicators
  - Active emergency responses
  - Real-time unit locations
  - SOS triggers and status

- Crowd Intelligence
  - Live crowd density heatmaps
  
  - Mass gathering monitoring
  - VIP movement tracking

- Traffic Monitoring
  - Real-time traffic flow
  - Accident detection
  - ANPR alerts
  - Traffic violation detection

- Emergency Response Status
  - Active emergency calls
  - Response times
  - Resource availability
  - Priority incidents queue

2. Resource Maps (Resource Tracking & Allocation)
- Force Deployment
  - Active patrol units
  - Special team locations
  - Quick response teams
  - Reserve forces

- Equipment Status
  - Vehicle availability
  - Special equipment tracking
  - Communication systems
  - Emergency response gear

- Infrastructure Overview
  - Camera network status
  - Emergency response points
  - Command posts
  - Critical facilities

- Personnel Management
  - Duty roster overview
  - Skill availability matrix
  - Special unit deployment
  - Staff allocation stats

3. AI Analytics (Predictive Intelligence)
- Crime Analytics
  - Hotspot prediction
  - Pattern recognition
  - Temporal analysis
  - Risk assessment

- Behavioral Analysis
  - Suspicious activity detection
  - Crowd behavior patterns
  - Traffic pattern analysis
  - Anomaly alerts

- Predictive Policing
  - Crime forecasting
  - Resource optimization
  - Patrol route suggestions
  - Strategic planning insights

- Performance Metrics
  - Response efficiency
  - Coverage analysis
  - Resource utilization
  - Operational effectiveness

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this dashboard with these organized categories? I'll create a new file `LiveDashboard.js` in the slide11 folder that implements these widgets with real-time updates and interactive features.

The dashboard will use a modular design where each category can be expanded for detailed view while maintaining an overview of critical information. Each widget will include real-time data visualization and AI-driven insights.

Should I proceed with the implementation?
